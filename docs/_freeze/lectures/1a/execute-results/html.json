Don't give up when it gets hard and seek out help when needed.\n\n# Use of Generative AI\n\n## Use of Generative AI\n\nThe use of generative artificial intelligence (AI) to complete any part or all of an assignment/exam is strictly prohibited in this class. This includes, but not limited to, ChatGPT, Claude, Meta AI, and Google Gemini.\n\n::: fragment\n\nYou may use AI to enhance you understanding of the material.\n\n:::\n\n::: fragment\n\nYou may not upload any course material to any AI platforms such as ChatGPT, Claude, Meta AI, and Google Gemini.  Exceptions are allowed for [DASS](https://www.csuci.edu/dass/)-approved services.\n\n\n:::\n\n## Use of AI\n\nThere are consequences when you use of AI:\n\n- Educational Mislearning\n- Trusting AI\n- Stolen Work\n- Privacy Concerns\n- Environmental Impacts\n- Working Exploitation\n\n\n\n## Educational Mislearning\n\nThe purpose of this class, and college, is for you to learn about critical thinking skills and perseverance. Using AI will only teach you how to get an answer, which may or may not be correct. \n\n::: fragment\nYou will not develop the skills needed to problem solve a challenge. Additionally, developing grit is essential to become successful in college and life. There is no easy way out and AI is an illusion to your success in life.\n:::\n\n\n::: fragment\nTo learn something, it requires hours of work!
